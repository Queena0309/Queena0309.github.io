- Persuasion, as one of the crucial abilities in human communication, has garnered extensive attention from researchers within the field of intelligent dialogue systems. The cognitive strategy-enhanced persuasive dialogue agent (defined as CogAgent), which incorporates cognitive strategies to achieve persuasive targets through conversation, has become a predominant research paradigm. We make a comprehensive survey of CogAgent.

[Cascade Context-oriented Spatio-temporal Attention Network for Efficient and Fine-grained Video-grounded Dialogue](https://journal.hep.com.cn/fcs/EN/10.1007/s11704-024-40387-w) \\
Hao Wang, Bin Guo, **Mengqi Chen**, Yasan Ding, Ying Zhang, Zhiwen Yu

- Video-Grounded Dialogue System (VGDS), focusing on generating reasonable responses based on multi-turn dialogue contexts and a given video, has received intensive attention recently. We propose a novel system, namely Cascade cOntext-oriented Spatial-Temporal Attention Network (COSTA), to generate reasonable responses efficiently and accurately.

[Memory-enhanced Emotional Support Conversations with Motivation-driven Strategy Inference](https://ecmlpkdd.org/2024/program-accepted-papers-research-track) \\
Hao Wang, Bin Guo, **Mengqi Chen**, Yasan Ding, Qiuyun Zhang, Ying Zhang, Zhiwen Yu

- The prevalence of mental disorders is increasing globally, highlighting the need for effective emotional support systems. Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) systems have emerged as a promising solution, providing supportive responses to individuals experiencing emotional distress. we propose MAGIC, a Memory-enhanced emotional support conversation system with motivation-driven strAteGy InferenCe.

[Improved faster R-CNN for fabric defect detection based on Gabor filter with Genetic Algorithm optimization]([https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3583758](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166361521001585)) \\
**Mengqi Chen**, Lingjie Yu, Chao Zhi, Runjun Sun, Shuangwu Zhu, Zhongyuan Gao, Zhenxia Ke, Mengqiu Zhu, Yuming Zhang

- Fabric defect detection plays a crucial role in fabric inspection and quality control. We improved the Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN) model by embedding Gabor kernels into Faster R-CNN, termed the Genetic Algorithm Gabor Faster R-CNN (Faster GG R-CNN).

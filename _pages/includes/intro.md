I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Technology, supervised by Prof. [Bin Guo (郭斌)](https://guob.org) at Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU), Xi’an, China. 

Before that, I received B.E. degree in Computer Science and Technology at NWPU in 2019, during which I participated in several student competitions and received the Outstanding Undergraduate Student and Outstanding Undergraduate Thesis awards.

My research interests include dialogue systems, large language models (LLMs), generative artificial intelligence (AI), social media mining, etc.


My research interest includes speech synthesis, neural machine translation and automatic music generation. I have published 50+ papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4FA6C0AAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FRayeRen%2Frayeren.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at the top international AI conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, KDD. 

To promote the communication among the Chinese ML & NLP community, we (along with other 11 young scholars worldwide) founded the [MLNLP community](https://space.bilibili.com/168887299) in 2021. I am honored to be one of the chairs of the MLNLP committee.
